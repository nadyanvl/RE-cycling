# RE-cycling Homepage Web
Homepage Web Project for the Front-End Beginner class at Dicoding.

This project involves the development of a simple web page with the theme of recycling trash, created using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. It also implements a responsive layout. This project was created as one of the requirements for obtaining the Dicoding class certificate - Belajar Dasar Pemrograman Web. The ideas, themes, illustrations, and code were developed and researched by myself, based on the material taught in class and various sources on the internet. I designed the illustrations using Affinity Designer software.

# RE-cycling Homepage Web
Homepage Web Project for Front-End Beginner class at Dicoding.

Development of a simple web page with the theme of recycling trash, which was developed using HTML, CSS, and a bit of Javascript. It also Implements a responsive layout. This project was created as one of the requirements to get the Dicoding class certificate - Belajar Dasar Pemrograman Web. The ideas, themes, illustrations, and codes were created and researched by myself based on the material that has been taught in class and various reading sources on the internet. I design the illustrations using Affinity Designer software.
